# Sandwich Club Project

The **Sandwich Club** app show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

It is a project during Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree Program.

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project
helps me to better understand how it is processed.

Through this project:
- I practice JSON parsing to a model object
- I design an activity layout
- I populate all fields in the layout accordingly

For this project I used the starter code, provided here:
